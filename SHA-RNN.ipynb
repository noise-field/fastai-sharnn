       "  xxmaj no further collections of the fungus were reported until 1937 , when it was found in xxmaj quebec , xxmaj canada . xxmaj the next year , xxmaj paul xxmaj xxunk considered the genus xxmaj xxunk to be superfluous , pointed out that the compound fruit bodies and the wrinkled hymenium were instead consistent with the genus xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj in 1939 , xxmaj american mycologist xxmaj lee xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk , in a letter to the journal xxmaj mycologia , opined that both of these authors had overlooked a 1925 publication by xxmaj calvin xxmaj henry xxmaj kauffman , who made notes and photos of the species collected in the xxmaj rocky xxmaj mountains of xxmaj wyoming and xxmaj colorado , and in the xxmaj cascade xxmaj mountains of xxmaj washington and xxmaj oregon . xxmaj kauffman believed the species to be merely \" a very extreme growth condition \" of xxmaj cantharellus clavatus ( now known as xxmaj gomphus clavatus ) and suggested there was no reason for transferring the species to the genus xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj mycologists xxmaj alexander xxup h. xxmaj smith and xxmaj elizabeth xxmaj morse , in their 1947 publication on xxmaj cantharellus species in the xxmaj united xxmaj states , placed the species in a new section xxmaj xxunk , but did not separate it from the genus xxmaj cantharellus ; they defined the distinguishing characteristics of xxmaj xxunk as the small , xxunk , hyaline spores and the color change of the flesh in potassium hydroxide solution , adding that \" the spores are unusual for the genus but in our estimation do not warrant excluding the species . \" \n",
       "  xxmaj in 1953 , xxunk xxmaj xxunk took into consideration differences in spore characteristics : species in the genus xxmaj cantharellus were not known to have spores that were xxunk ( roughly spherical ) and xxunk ( covered with xxunk - like projections ) like xxmaj xxunk ; however , these spore characteristics were common in species in the xxmaj xxunk family ( xxmaj cantharellus belongs in a different family , the xxunk ) . xxmaj other characteristics linking the blue chanterelle with the xxmaj xxunk included the dark color , the strong odor ( especially in dried specimens ) , and the presence of xxunk acid , a mushroom pigment common in the family . xxmaj taken together , these factors led xxmaj xxunk to propose the new family xxunk . xxmaj the suggested family - level xxunk change was not accepted by other authors ; for example , in 1954 , xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk renamed it xxmaj xxunk multiplex . xxmaj as of 2009 , both xxmaj index xxmaj fungorum and xxunk list xxmaj xxunk as being within the xxmaj xxunk family , a grouping of mushrooms commonly known as the leathery xxunk . xxmaj the genus name is derived from the xxmaj greek poly meaning many , and oz , meaning branch . xxmaj the specific epithet multiplex means \" in many pieces \" , referring to the compound nature of the fruit body . xxmaj common names for this species include the blue chanterelle and the clustered blue chanterelle . xxmaj in xxmaj alaska , where specimens typically have very dark - colored fruit bodies , it is called the black chanterelle , although this name is shared with some xxmaj xxunk species . \n",

       "  xxmaj xxunk multiplex is part of the group of fungi collectively known as xxunk mushrooms ( which includes the genera xxmaj cantharellus , xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj gomphus , and xxmaj xxunk ) because of the similarity of their fruit body structures and the morphology of the spore - producing region ( the xxunk ) on the underside of the caps . xxmaj the xxunk or funnel - shaped fruit bodies of the black chanterelle grow clustered together on the ground , often in large masses that may reach aggregate diameters of up to 1 meter ( 3.3 ft ) , although they are usually up to 30 centimeters ( 11.8 in ) . \n",

       "  xxmaj the latest scientific studies of the ash produced by xxmaj vesuvius reveals a multi - phase eruption . xxmaj the initial major explosion produced a column of ash and pumice ranging between 15 and 30 kilometres ( 49,000 and 98,000 ft ) high , which rained on xxmaj pompeii to the southeast but not on xxmaj xxunk xxunk . xxmaj the chief energy supporting the column came from the escape of steam xxunk by the magma , created from ground water xxunk over time into the deep faults of the region . \n",
       "  xxmaj subsequently the cloud collapsed as the gases expanded and lost their capability to support their solid contents , releasing it as a pyroclastic surge , which reached xxmaj xxunk but not xxmaj pompeii . xxmaj additional explosions xxunk the column . xxmaj the eruption alternated between xxmaj plinian and xxmaj xxunk six times . xxmaj surges 3 and 4 are believed by the authors to have destroyed xxmaj pompeii . xxmaj surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross - bedding formations , which are not produced by fallout . \n",
       "  xxmaj another study used the magnetic characteristics of over 200 samples of roof - tile and plaster fragments collected around xxmaj pompeii to estimate equilibrium temperature of the pyroclastic flow . xxmaj the magnetic study revealed that on the first day of the eruption a fall of white pumice containing xxunk fragments of up to 3 centimetres ( 1.2 in ) fell for several hours . xxmaj it heated the roof tiles up to 140 ° c ( 284 ° f ) . xxmaj this period would have been the last opportunity to escape . \n",
       "  xxmaj the collapse of the xxmaj plinian columns on the second day caused pyroclastic density currents ( xxunk ) that devastated xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj pompeii . xxmaj the xxunk temperature of these pyroclastic surges ranged up to 300 ° c ( 572 ° f ) . xxmaj any population remaining in structural refuges could not have escaped , as the city was surrounded by gases of xxunk temperatures . xxmaj the lowest temperatures were in rooms under collapsed roofs . xxmaj these were as low as 100 ° c ( 212 ° f ) . \n",

       "  xxmaj magma sitting in an underground chamber for many years will start to see higher melting point constituents such as olivine xxunk out . xxmaj the effect is to increase the concentration of dissolved gases ( mostly steam and carbon dioxide ) in the remaining liquid magma , making the subsequent eruption more violent . xxmaj as gas - rich magma approaches the surface during an eruption , the huge drop in pressure caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock ( which drops to zero at the surface ) causes the gases to come out of solution , the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying magma . xxmaj additionally , the removal of the higher melting point material will raise the concentration of xxunk components such as silicates potentially making the magma more viscous , adding to the explosive nature of the eruption . \n",

       "  xxmaj the first published description of the species was written by botanist xxmaj lucien xxup m. xxmaj underwood in 1899 , based on a specimen found the previous year in the woods of xxmaj mount xxmaj desert , xxmaj maine . xxmaj although he called the new species a xxmaj cantharellus , he noted that \" the plant is a remarkable one and from its habit might well form a distinct genus since it has little in common with xxmaj cantharellus except its fold - like gills . \" xxmaj in 1910 , xxmaj william xxmaj murrill transferred it to the new genus xxmaj xxunk ; xxmaj murrill thought the compound structure of the stem to be a sufficiently unique characteristic to warrant it being separated from xxmaj cantharellus species , which have simpler stem structures . xxmaj in 1920 , specimens from a xxmaj japanese collection compiled by xxup a. xxmaj xxunk were sent to mycologist xxmaj curtis xxmaj gates xxmaj lloyd , who believed the fungus to be a new species and named it xxunk xxunk . \n",
       "  xxmaj no further collections of the fungus were reported until 1937 , when it was found in xxmaj quebec , xxmaj canada . xxmaj the next year , xxmaj paul xxmaj xxunk considered the genus xxmaj xxunk to be superfluous , pointed out that the compound fruit bodies and the wrinkled hymenium were instead consistent with the genus xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj in 1939 , xxmaj american mycologist xxmaj lee xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk , in a letter to the journal xxmaj mycologia , opined that both of these authors had overlooked a 1925 publication by xxmaj calvin xxmaj henry xxmaj kauffman , who made notes and photos of the species collected in the xxmaj rocky xxmaj mountains of xxmaj wyoming and xxmaj colorado , and in the xxmaj cascade xxmaj mountains of xxmaj washington and xxmaj oregon . xxmaj kauffman believed the species to be merely \" a very extreme growth condition \" of xxmaj cantharellus clavatus ( now known as xxmaj gomphus clavatus ) and suggested there was no reason for transferring the species to the genus xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj mycologists xxmaj alexander xxup h. xxmaj smith and xxmaj elizabeth xxmaj morse , in their 1947 publication on xxmaj cantharellus species in the xxmaj united xxmaj states , placed the species in a new section xxmaj xxunk , but did not separate it from the genus xxmaj cantharellus ; they defined the distinguishing characteristics of xxmaj xxunk as the small , xxunk , hyaline spores and the color change of the flesh in potassium hydroxide solution , adding that \" the spores are unusual for the genus but in our estimation do not warrant excluding the species . \" \n",
       "  xxmaj in 1953 , xxunk xxmaj xxunk took into consideration differences in spore characteristics : species in the genus xxmaj cantharellus were not known to have spores that were xxunk ( roughly spherical ) and xxunk ( covered with xxunk - like projections ) like xxmaj xxunk ; however , these spore characteristics were common in species in the xxmaj xxunk family ( xxmaj cantharellus belongs in a different family , the xxunk ) . xxmaj other characteristics linking the blue chanterelle with the xxmaj xxunk included the dark color , the strong odor ( especially in dried specimens ) , and the presence of xxunk acid , a mushroom pigment common in the family . xxmaj taken together , these factors led xxmaj xxunk to propose the new family xxunk . xxmaj the suggested family - level xxunk change was not accepted by other authors ; for example , in 1954 , xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk renamed it xxmaj xxunk multiplex . xxmaj as of 2009 , both xxmaj index xxmaj fungorum and xxunk list xxmaj xxunk as being within the xxmaj xxunk family , a grouping of mushrooms commonly known as the leathery xxunk . xxmaj the genus name is derived from the xxmaj greek poly meaning many , and oz , meaning branch . xxmaj the specific epithet multiplex means \" in many pieces \" , referring to the compound nature of the fruit body . xxmaj common names for this species include the blue chanterelle and the clustered blue chanterelle . xxmaj in xxmaj alaska , where specimens typically have very dark - colored fruit bodies , it is called the black chanterelle , although this name is shared with some xxmaj xxunk species . \n",

       "  xxmaj xxunk multiplex is part of the group of fungi collectively known as xxunk mushrooms ( which includes the genera xxmaj cantharellus , xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj gomphus , and xxmaj xxunk ) because of the similarity of their fruit body structures and the morphology of the spore - producing region ( the xxunk ) on the underside of the caps . xxmaj the xxunk or funnel - shaped fruit bodies of the black chanterelle grow clustered together on the ground , often in large masses that may reach aggregate diameters of up to 1 meter ( 3.3 ft ) , although they are usually up to 30 centimeters ( 11.8 in ) . \n",
